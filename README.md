# Airport Placement Optimization- DSA210 Project


## Project Overview
In this project, I’ll analyze air traffic and airport congestion to explore where new airports are most needed in busy airspaces. By examining flight density, delays, and capacity data, I aim to identify key bottlenecks and their causes. Using data visualization and machine learning, I plan to highlight the most overloaded airports and suggest optimal locations for new ones. My goal is to provide data-driven insights that improve air traffic flow and support smarter airport planning.

## Objectives
1. **Understand Air Traffic Patterns and Bottlenecks**
   
    Explore the relationship between air traffic density, airport delays, airspace congestion, airport capacity, and flight distribution to understand how and where congestion impacts
   flight efficiency.

2. **Identify Critical Regions for New Airport**
   
   Identify the most congested airspaces and where a new airport could best reduce delays and improve traffic flow.
   
 3. **Data-Driven Infrastructure Planning**

    Use traffic and delay data to recommend ideal sites for new airports, enabling data-driven solutions for more efficient air traffic and urban planning."

## How the Data Will Be Used
Each dataset is utilized to answer a specific research question about U.S. airport congestion and flight delays. Below is a breakdown of how 
the data contributes:

## 1. Flight Performance Data — final_enriched_airport_dataset.csv
• Purpose:
Identify patterns of congestion and delay based on flight activity and scheduling.
• Usage:

Calculate departure and arrival delays

Create a binary is_congested flag

Provide features for classification and clustering

## 2. Weather Conditions by Airport — weather_meteo_by_airport.csv
• Purpose:
Quantify the effect of meteorological conditions on delays.
• Usage:

Merge with flight data using IATA_CODE and FlightDate

Use weather variables such as Precipitation, Snow, WindSpeed, and AvgTemp

Enable weather-aware flight clustering

## 3. Airport Metadata — airports.csv and airports_geolocation.csv
• Purpose:
Enhance interpretability of results through contextual and geographic airport information.
• Usage:

Map IATA_CODE to airport name and city

Add readable labels in outputs (e.g., for most delayed flights by cluster)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To understand the flight delay dataset before applying machine learning or testing hypotheses, we conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis. This included examining delay trends across cities, airlines, weather conditions, and operational features such as flight time, distance, and daily/seasonal effects.

### 1. Data Quality and Missing Values
The dataset was checked for missing values in key fields such as weather conditions (*precipitation, snow, wind speed, temperature*), delay components (*carrier, NAS, weather, security, last aircraft*), and timestamps.  
➡️ Rows with missing values in selected features were excluded from modeling to ensure clustering accuracy.

---

### 2. Outlier Detection
Boxplots of departure delays by distance category revealed a large number of extreme outliers — especially in **short and medium haul** flights.  
➡️ Delays exceeding **1000 minutes** were retained, as they represent real operational disruptions rather than data errors.

---

### 3. Delay Distribution & Skewness
Delay data exhibited significant **right skew**.  
➡️ Most flights experienced minimal or no delay, but a small subset showed **extreme delays**.  
➡️ This pattern was consistent across visualizations (by **airline**, **city**, **weather**) and highlights the importance of modeling tail behaviors.

### 4. Summary of Key Patterns

- **Time of Day**: Afternoon flights tend to have the **highest average delays**, suggesting compounding delays throughout the day.
- **Top Delay Cities**: Airports in smaller or less connected cities (e.g., *Alpena, MI* and *Pellston, MI*) experienced the **longest average departure delays**.
- **Delay Causes**: Delays due to **last aircraft arrival** and **NAS (National Airspace System)** were the **most significant contributors**.
- **Weather Impact**: Surprisingly, the **highest delays** were observed in **low precipitation conditions** (0–0.1 inch), possibly due to **indirect operational factors**.
- **Airlines & Airports**: Airlines like **JetBlue Airways** and airports like **ATL** and **MCO** showed **consistently high delay metrics**.

## Hypothesis Testing

To investigate statistically significant patterns behind flight delays, four hypothesis tests were conducted. These tests aimed to identify the impact of weather, airport traffic, and cancellations on average departure delays.

---

### **Test 1: Impact of Rainfall on Departure Delay**

![Figure 1 – Delay by Precipitation](outputs/indir%20(9).png)

- **Objective**: Assess whether average delays differ significantly between rainy days (precipitation > 1.0 inch) and dry days.
- **Test Used**: Mann–Whitney U Test (non-parametric)
- **Sample Size**:  
  - Rainy Days: 45,506 flights  
  - Dry Days: 49,342 flights  
- **Normality**: Both groups failed the Shapiro-Wilk test  
- **Variance**: Levene’s Test p = 1.48e⁻¹² ⇒ variances are unequal  
- **Result**: p-value = **0.00015**

**Conclusion**:  
There is a statistically significant difference in delays between rainy and dry days. Delays tend to be higher during rainy days, confirming the operational impact of precipitation on flight punctuality.

---

### **Test 2: Airport Traffic vs. Departure Delay**

![Figure 2 – Delay vs Flight Count](outputs/indir%20(11).png)

- **Objective**: Determine whether airports with higher flight volume experience greater average delays.
- **Test Used**: Pearson Correlation
- **Result**:  
  - Pearson r = 0.0024  
  - p-value = 0.9657

**Conclusion**:  
There is **no significant correlation** between the number of flights and average delay. High traffic volume alone does not predict increased delays. Infrastructure efficiency likely plays a larger role.

---

### **Test 3: Passenger Load vs. Departure Delay**

![Figure 3 – Passenger Load Delay Correlation](outputs/indir%20(10).png)

- **Objective**: Assess if higher passenger loads are linked with longer delays.
- **Test Used**: Pearson Correlation  
- **Result**:  
  - Pearson r = 0.0023  
  - p-value = 0.9667

**Conclusion**:  
There is **no significant linear correlation** between passenger volume and departure delays. Delay patterns are more influenced by operational factors than passenger numbers.

---

### **Test 4: Cancellation vs. Departure Delay**

![Figure 4 – Cancelled Flight Rate](outputs/indir%20(1).png)

![Figure 5 – Diverted Flight Rate](outputs/indir%20(13).png)

- **Objective**: Determine if flights that are eventually cancelled show significantly higher average delays before cancellation.
- **Test Used**: Welch’s t-test  
- **Result**:  
  - t-statistic = -41.166  
  - p-value < 0.001


**Insight**:  
Approximately **15.8% of flights** were diverted, highlighting a substantial source of operational disruption that may tie into weather, traffic, or emergency protocols.

**Conclusion**:  
Cancelled flights show **significantly higher departure delays** prior to cancellation. These results support using delay metrics as early indicators of cancellation risk.



## 🧠 Machine Learning Analysis

To uncover hidden patterns in flight delay conditions, we applied unsupervised machine learning techniques — **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **KMeans Clustering** — on standardized environmental and delay variables.

### 📌 Methodology

- **Selected Features**:
  - `Dep_Delay`: Departure delay (min)
  - `Arr_Delay`: Arrival delay (min)
  - `Precipitation`, `Snow`, `WindSpeed`, `AvgTemp`

- **Pipeline**:
  - All features were **standardized**.
  - **PCA** reduced them to 2 components explaining ~93% of total variance.
  - **KMeans** clustered flights into **3 operational categories**.
