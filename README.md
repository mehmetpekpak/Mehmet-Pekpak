# Airport Placement Optimization- DSA210 Project


## Project Overview
In this project, I’ll analyze air traffic and airport congestion to explore where new airports are most needed in busy airspaces. By examining flight density, delays, and capacity data, I aim to identify key bottlenecks and their causes. Using data visualization and machine learning, I plan to highlight the most overloaded airports and suggest optimal locations for new ones. My goal is to provide data-driven insights that improve air traffic flow and support smarter airport planning.

## Objectives
1. **Understand Air Traffic Patterns and Bottlenecks**
   
    Explore the relationship between air traffic density, airport delays, airspace congestion, airport capacity, and flight distribution to understand how and where congestion impacts
   flight efficiency.

2. **Identify Critical Regions for New Airport**
   
   Identify the most congested airspaces and where a new airport could best reduce delays and improve traffic flow.
   
 3. **Data-Driven Infrastructure Planning**

    Use traffic and delay data to recommend ideal sites for new airports, enabling data-driven solutions for more efficient air traffic and urban planning."

4. **Apply Data Science Methodologies**
   
     Apply the data collection, analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques learned in DSA 210 to address a complex, real-world aviation problem, enhancing both technical
   and analytical skills.

## Motivation 

This project consists multi-diciplinear area which I interested and this project might solve aviation and daily life problem. 

-**Problem Solving**

Delays and overcrowding at airports are challenging issues that affect everyone. This daily problem motivated me to focus on this project and explore data-driven solutions to improve 
air traffic efficiency.

-**Personal Interest**

Aviation has always fascinated me—not just from a technological perspective, but also in terms of the complex systems that keep global travel running smoothly. Exploring how data can 
solve real challenges in air traffic gives me a chance to dive deeper into a field I care about.


-**Application Of Class**

This project allows me to apply everything I’ve learned in DSA 210 to a real-world, high-impact problem. It’s an opportunity to turn theoretical knowledge into practical insights that 
could influence future infrastructure decisions.

-**Increasing Efficietcy**

Beyond the scope of this project, I’m motivated by the potential of data science to contribute to smarter, more sustainable urban and transportation planning. I hope my work here can 
be a small step toward making air travel more efficient and accessible.

## Dataset

This project utilizes real-world datasets to analyze air traffic congestion and explore the need for new airport locations. Below are the key datasets I will be working with:

**Flight Records and Delays:**

maj us flight - january 2024.csv: Detailed U.S. flight data for January 2024, including flight times, routes, delays, and cancellations.
Cancelled_Diverted_2023.csv: Records of canceled and diverted flights across 2023 to identify operational bottlenecks and airspace issues.

**Airport Geolocation and Capacity Data:**

airports_geolocation.csv: Geographical coordinates of airports to analyze spatial distribution and gaps in service.
airports.csv: Full list of airports with additional metadata for capacity and classification.

**Airline Information:**

airlines.csv: Information on airline operators to assess traffic concentration and airline-specific delays.

**Passenger Statistics:**

Air_Traffic_Passenger_Statistics.csv: Passenger flow data to understand airport demand and usage patterns.

**Weather Data:**

weather_meteo_by_airport.csv: Weather conditions (e.g., wind, precipitation, visibility) at different airports to analyze their impact on delays and congestion.
